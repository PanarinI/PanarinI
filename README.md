- 👋 Hi, I’m @PanarinI
- 👀 I’m interested in DA, AI, NLP, social satire, cultural problems of nonsense education
- 🌱 I’m currently (18.12.2024) working on a couple of projects -
- *  MirrorMind: revealing the '**hidden layer' of collective mind** in group chats
  *  'School named after Poslushniy' a **satirical fake digital community** + problematization of authoritarian-style school (and beyond) systems
  *  'A man in the world' which is a atmospheric beautiful game on philosophical and psychologocal aspects of **connection and its loss between people**
- 💞️ I’m to collaborate and communicate on those or yours.
