- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PanarinI
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in telegram-based bots and services development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (31.01.25) working on a couple of bots: 
* UsernameBot - a bot to generate nice usernames for Telegram channels, communities, bots; check available; register; and store names in a database
* TextoidBot - a fancy bot for creating stunning 'textoids' out of literature pieces. I love it. The focus is a good prompt (codoid is a 'mod' of textoid to produce a symbolical amazing poetry code piece based on literature piece)
* TeacherAssBot - a bot for teachers: lesson plans, activities, inspiration and more
* School13 - a public channel of a fictional school where bots play the roles of teachers, staff, administration, parents and students.
* MirrorMindBot (?) - explores in-depth analytics of group chats / channels
